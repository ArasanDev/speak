// SpeakCore/Engine/SpeakError.swift
//
// The single error type for the dictation engine. Each case carries a
// user-facing `recoverySuggestion` so the UI never has to map errors to copy.
// Signatures are verbatim from `docs/architecture.md` §6.
//
// ADDITIVE CASE (surfaced, not papered over): `.microphoneMuted` is NOT in the
// §6 verbatim list. It was added for the hardware-mute privacy guarantee
// (SPEC §7.4 / product.md §8 #4): when capture is muted, `SpeakEngine.beginDictation`
// refuses to start a session and throws this — the bypass-proof enforcement point
// (no `CaptureSession`/audio is ever constructed). It is a *refusal*, not a fault:
// the app shell catches it specifically and stays idle rather than entering `.error`.
//
// ADDITIVE CASE (graceful degradation): `.pasteRequiresAccessibility` is thrown by
// `PasteboardWriter.insert(_:)` when `AXIsProcessTrusted()` returns false. The text
// has already been written to the clipboard (the clipboard floor runs first, always),
// so this is a *degraded delivery*, not a data-loss fault. The app shell catches it
// specifically: sets `permissionsNeeded = true` and leaves the icon `.idle` (text on
// clipboard), not `.error`. Per spec dictation-flow.md §5 + §6-D.
