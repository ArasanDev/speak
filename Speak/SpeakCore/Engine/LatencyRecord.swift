// SpeakCore/Engine/LatencyRecord.swift
//
// Per-dictation stop→paste timing breakdown captured by `CaptureSession.stop()`.
// Used to derive latency statistics for the Insights pane (benchmark.md §7).
//
// TERMINOLOGY (aligned to benchmark.md §7):
//   The headline metric is `stopToPasteSeconds` for BOTH populations:
//   • stop→paste (raw path):     t_stop → t_pasted, cleanup was NOT run.
//                                Population: `cleanupSeconds == 0.0` (exact sentinel).
//   • stop→paste (full path):    t_stop → t_pasted, cleanup WAS run.
//                                Population: `cleanupSeconds > 0`.
//
// SENTINEL DESIGN (P13):
//   `cleanupSeconds` is NOT a DispatchTime delta between two DispatchTime.now() calls
//   in `stop()`. It comes from `runCleanup()`, which returns the **exact literal 0.0**
//   for the cleaner-nil and unavailable paths — not a measured interval. This is the
//   only way to make the `== 0` discriminator in `LatencyStats` reliable in production.
//   If this were a live delta, actor re-scheduling jitter would produce ~1µs on the
//   no-cleanup paths, and the "raw" population would appear empty (every entry misclassified
//   as cleanup). [decision P13: sentinel from runCleanup, not a delta in stop().]
//
// [inferred] The brief's item-1 parenthetical "raw latency = t_transcript_ready→t_paste"
// differs from benchmark.md §7 "stop→paste". We follow §7 (the objective function).
// Surfaced for the orchestrator.
//
// THREADING: `Sendable` struct — safe to create inside the `CaptureSession` actor
// and pass out to `TranscriptionResult`.
